Rentals management system

Project Overview 
The Rentals Management system is inspired by the market gap of lack of a system that connects landlords/landladies and tenants. It is supposed to solve the problem of tenants traveling all over a town to look for a  new rental house. It will give Landlords/Landladies an opportunity to advertise their apartments from the comfort of their homes while tenants will be able to know unoccupied apartments just from where theyâ€™re. It will provide an additional premium package for landlords/landladies to manage the rentals financially i.e. rent collection.
